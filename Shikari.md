1. __*Fork*__ the repository that you want to work with
2. __*Clone*__ your version of the repository to your computer
3. Make new branch with your brilliant ideas
4. __*Push*__ all changes to your version of the repository on GitHub
5. __*Pull request*__ with your changes to the author of the original repository
6. Take a rest
7. Enjoy being respected
